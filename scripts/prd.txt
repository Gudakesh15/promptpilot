Prompt Pilot

Overview:
A Chrome extension that adds an "AI Generate" button next to each LinkedIn post in the feed. When clicked, it extracts the content of the post, sends it to a specified API endpoint, and upon receiving a response, copies the result to the clipboard and inserts it into the comment box for that post.

Goals:
- Add a visible, intuitive "AI Generate" button next to every LinkedIn post in the user's feed.
- On button click, extract the post content, send it to a backend API, and handle the response.
- Automatically copy the API response to the clipboard and insert it into the comment box, ready for the user to post.
- The extension should not disrupt the normal LinkedIn experience.

Functional Requirements:
1. Inject an "AI Generate" button next to each LinkedIn post in the feed.
   - The button should match LinkedIn's UI and be clearly labeled.
   - The button should appear dynamically as new posts load (infinite scroll support).
2. When the button is clicked, extract the full text content of the corresponding LinkedIn post.
   - Only the content of the specific post should be captured.
3. Send a POST request to the API endpoint:
   - Endpoint: https://aviking15.app.n8n.cloud/webhook-test/bccb1a8d-9b2c-4a48-b093-f99a1e23e889
   - Payload: { "post": "<extracted post content>" }
   - Handle API errors gracefully (e.g., show a notification if the request fails).
4. On successful API response:
   - Copy the response text to the user's clipboard.
   - Insert the response text into the comment box of the same LinkedIn post.
5. Provide visual feedback (e.g., loading spinner, success checkmark, or error message) after the button is clicked.
   - Notify the user when the response is copied and inserted.
6. Request only the minimum Chrome extension permissions required (e.g., access to linkedin.com, clipboard).
   - Do not store or transmit user data except as required for the API call.

Non-Functional Requirements:
- The extension should not noticeably slow down LinkedIn page loads or scrolling.
- Must work on the latest version of Chrome and with the current LinkedIn feed layout.
- Should handle LinkedIn DOM changes gracefully (e.g., via robust selectors or mutation observers).
- No data should be stored or shared beyond the API call.

Out of Scope:
- No user authentication or settings panel.
- No support for LinkedIn mobile app or other browsers.
- No analytics or tracking.

Example User Flow:
1. User installs the extension and navigates to LinkedIn.
2. For each post in the feed, an "AI Generate" button appears.
3. User clicks the button next to a post.
4. The extension extracts the post content and sends it to the API.
5. The extension waits for the API response.
6. On success, the response is copied to the clipboard and inserted into the comment box for that post.
7. User can review/edit and post the comment.

Open Questions:
- Should the extension support LinkedIn articles or only feed posts?
- Should there be a way to disable/enable the extension on demand?
- Should the user be able to customize the API endpoint or payload?
