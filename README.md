# Prompt Pilot

A Chrome extension that adds an "AI Generate" button next to each LinkedIn post in your feed. With a single click, it extracts the post content, sends it to an AI API, and automatically copies the response to your clipboard and inserts it into the comment boxâ€”making it easy to generate thoughtful replies in seconds.
